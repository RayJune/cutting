/*
 * 107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II
 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: root = [3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]
 * Output: [[15, 7], [9, 20], [3]]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: root = []
 * Output: []
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: root = [1]
 * Output: [[1]]
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
 * -100 <= Node.val <= 100
